Description:
The name is pretty self-explanitory, whatever's in your head goes on the wall. This was a project I built with a goal to sharpen my GraphQL skills.

Tech Stack: <br/>
  • ReactJS, NextJS <br/>
  • GraphQL [Apollo Server / Client] <br/>
  • MongoDB <br/>
<br/>
Goals:<br/>
There are still a lot of things to add some of which would be:<br/>
  • Data sorting [Highes rated daily, weekly, all time]<br/>
  • Display user profiles<br/>
  • Changing user data [password, email, nickname]
