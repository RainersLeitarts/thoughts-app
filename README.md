Description:
The name is pretty self-explanitory, whatever's in your head goes on the wall. This was a project I built with a goal to sharpen my GraphQL skills. It is built with React, NextJS, MongoDB, GraphQL [Apollo Server / Client]

Tech Stack:
  • ReactJS, NextJS
  • GraphQL [Apollo Server / Client]
  • MongoDB

Goals:
There are still a lot of things to add some of which would be:
  • Data sorting [Highes rated daily, weekly, all time]
  • Display user profiles
  • Changing user data [password, email, nickname]
